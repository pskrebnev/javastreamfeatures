In Java 7 the AsynchronousFileChannel was added to Java NIO.
The AsynchronousFileChannel makes it possible to read data from,
and write data to files asynchronously. This tutorial will explain how
to use the AsynchronousFileChannel.

Generate artificial datasets with the same characteristics
as real data, so you can develop and test AI models
without compromising privacy.

Obsidian stores your notes as Markdown-formatted plain text files in a vault.
 A vault is a folder on your local file system, including any subfolders.

Because notes are plain text files, you can use other text editors and file
 managers to edit and manage notes. Obsidian automatically refreshes your
  vault to keep up with any external changes.

You can create a vault anywhere your operating system allows. Obsidian
 syncs with Obsidian Sync, Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, Git, and many other
  third-party services.

You can open multiple folders as individual vaults, for example
 to separate notes for work and personal use.
